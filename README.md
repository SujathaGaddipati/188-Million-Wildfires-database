# 1.88-Million-Wildfires-database
## Introduction
The repositorie contains 1.88 Million records of wildfires that occured in US from 1992 to 2015. It can be downlodaded from the kaggle website as SqLite database. We took the database, prepared a 3NF ER model on MySQL workbench and uploaded the whole database into SQL and MongoDB. The whole purpose of the project was to learn data handling, cleaning and querying difference in relational v/s non relational database. Due to the size limit I could not upload the .sql file, the data handling files are uploaded as .R files.
